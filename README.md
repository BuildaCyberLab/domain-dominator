**Uncover. Dominate. Secure.**  

**Domain Dominator** is a powerful Python tool for advanced subdomain enumeration and vulnerability detection. It resolves DNS records, maps services, and identifies misconfigurations that could lead to subdomain takeovers, such as unclaimed AWS S3 buckets or GitHub Pages. Lightweight, fast, and open-source, itâ€™s designed for penetration testers, bug bounty hunters, and cybersecurity professionals.  

---

## **Features**  
- **Subdomain Enumeration:** Discover subdomains using public sources like `crt.sh`.  
- **DNS Resolution:** Map DNS records (CNAME, A) to identify associated services.  
- **Takeover Detection:** Detect vulnerabilities in services like AWS S3, Heroku, Azure, etc.  
- **HTTP Validation:** Check if subdomains are live and serving content.  
- **Actionable Reports:** Generate clean JSON reports for analysis.
