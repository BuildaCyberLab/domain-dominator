### **Overview**

# **Domain Dominator**  
**Uncover. Dominate. Secure.**  

Domain Dominator is a powerful Python tool designed for subdomain enumeration, DNS analysis, and subdomain takeover vulnerability detection. This tool is built for penetration testers, bug bounty hunters, and cybersecurity researchers who need a reliable, scalable, and efficient solution for domain reconnaissance.

### **Key Features**
1. **Subdomain Enumeration:**  
   - Automatically discovers subdomains using public sources like `crt.sh`.  
   - Supports adding custom wordlists for brute-forcing.

2. **DNS Resolution:**  
   - Resolves DNS records such as CNAME, A, and others.  
   - Maps subdomains to external services.

3. **Vulnerability Detection:**  
   - Identifies misconfigured services prone to subdomain takeovers (e.g., AWS S3, Heroku, GitHub Pages).  
   - Provides actionable insights in JSON format.

4. **HTTP Validation:**  
   - Verifies if subdomains are live and serving content.  

5. **Report Generation:**  
   - Clean JSON reports that are easy to integrate with other tools.

### **How It Works**
**Domain Dominator** operates in four main stages:  
1. **Subdomain Discovery:**  
   - Leverages public data sources and optional brute-forcing to find subdomains.  

2. **DNS Resolution:**  
   - Checks DNS records for each subdomain to identify CNAMEs or misconfigurations.  

3. **Vulnerability Analysis:**  
   - Matches DNS results against a predefined list of vulnerable services (e.g., AWS S3).  

4. **Reporting:**  
   - Outputs results in JSON format for easy review or integration with external tools.

---

### **Supported Services**
Domain Dominator detects vulnerabilities for common cloud services, including:  
- **AWS S3 Buckets**  
- **GitHub Pages**  
- **Heroku Apps**  
- **Azure Web Apps**  
- **CloudFront Distributions**  
- **Unbounce Pages**  

More services can be added by editing the predefined vulnerability database in `main.py`.

### **Example Workflow**

#### **Input:**
```bash
python main.py --domain example.com --output report.json
```

#### **Process:**
1. **Enumerates subdomains** like `app.example.com`, `test.example.com`.  
2. **Resolves DNS records**, identifying CNAMEs or services.  
3. **Matches misconfigured services**, such as:  
   - CNAME: `unclaimed.s3.amazonaws.com` â†’ **AWS S3 bucket may be unclaimed.**  
4. **Generates actionable reports** in JSON format.

#### **Output:**
```json
[
  {
    "subdomain": "vulnerable.example.com",
    "cname": "unclaimed.s3.amazonaws.com",
    "issue": "AWS S3 bucket may be unclaimed."
  }
]
```

### **Future Enhancements**
1. **Additional Service Support:**  
   - Extend detection to services like Netlify, DigitalOcean Spaces, etc.

2. **API Integrations:**  
   - Integrate with VirusTotal, Shodan, or SecurityTrails for advanced reconnaissance.  

3. **Output Formats:**  
   - Add support for CSV, HTML, or PDF reports.  

4. **Custom Vulnerability Detection:**  
   - Allow users to define their own misconfiguration patterns.

5. **GUI Version:**  
   - Create a graphical interface for non-technical users.
